Kronometer TODO list
=====================

1. Stopwatch controls while kronometer's window is in background. This can be done in at least to ways:
	a. System Tray Icon using KStatusNotifierItem, whit a contextual menu which holds the relevant actions (start/pause/reset/lap).
	b. KDE notifications, where the notification shows the running timer (while a tray icon doesn't) and the buttons to start/pause/reset the stopwatch.
