Kronometer TODO list
=====================

1. Rewrite the entire UI in QtQuick? With fancy effects like those on Gnome and Android stopwatch apps?

2. Stopwatch controls while kronometer's window is in background.
   QSystemTrayIcon or KStatusNotifierItem? What if there is more than one Kronometer window?

3. Fix race condition when the same session is opened on more than one window.
